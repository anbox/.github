## IMPORTANT - Hi there ðŸ‘‹


The Anbox project [was once ago created in 2017](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/04/android-apps-linux-desktop-anbox) to bring Android to any Linux based desktop operating system. It's development has however stalled in the past years and it's only fair to say that now in 2023 it's no longer actively developed.

In the past years new alternatives have came up which are carrying the same idea of a containerized Android forward:

If you're looking for a solution to run Android on your Linux desktop:

* [Waydroid](https://waydro.id/) is rebuilding the original idea behind Anbox with explicit focus on modern [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) powered desktop environments.

If you're looking for a solution to run Android in the cloud:

* [Anbox Cloud](https://anbox-cloud.io) as a solution developed by [Canonical](https://canonical.com), the company behind [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com), to bring Android at scale to any cloud with support for ultra low latency video streaming and recent Android versions.

The existing repositories will remain as is but no active maintence will be applied going forward.

*Thank you all for your support!*
